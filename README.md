1. README is this document
2. Screenshot of Rails startup is titled: rails_startup_screen.png
3. Writeup is titled: cvwo_midsubmission_writeup.pdf

How to Run
1. get Docker, docker-compose
2. in the current directory, `$ docker-compose up --build`
3. go to localhost:3000

NOTE: for the first time you can try going to backend/bin/entry and uncomment the `rails db:seed` before running step2 docker-compose. 
This seeds the database with dummy data, but on subsequent times, comment the line again to prevent conflicting entries in the database
